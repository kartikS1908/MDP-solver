# Markov Decision Problem Solver

## Problem
A 2D grid world of some dimensions is divided into cells which may be unclean or clean. The flooring type of each cell is also different. A robot vaccum moves across the grid world and it may or may not clean the cell with certain probabilities. This problem has been modeled as an MDP and 2 methods of solving the MDP have been implemented. The offline solver uses Value iteration whereas the online solver uses real time dynamic programming.
